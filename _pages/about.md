Hi! I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology under [Prof. Divya Mahajan](https://www.divyamahajan.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India (M365 Research Group) with [Dr. Anjaly Parayil](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aparayil/) and [Dr. Ankur Mallick](https://ankurmallick.github.io/).

My work at Microsoft has focused on improving data center efficiency and serving low latency ML inference workloads. We are looking at ways to improve the serving of LLM workloads on a datacenter level, with multiple models and hardwares available and millions of requests coming in each hour.

Prior to Microsoft, I completed my Bachelors + Masters (by Research) from IIIT Hyderabad, where I was a Research Assistant at the Computer Systems Group. During my time at IIIT, I worked on building a scalable and distributed architecture for large scale camera networks, focused on a city to country wide scale. I also worked on Bayesian Optimization and how the algorithm can be adapted to various experimental settings. 

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to discuss any ideas or problems!
