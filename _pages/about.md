Hi, I am Kunal. I am a researcher focussed on improving data center efficiency and serving low latency ML inference workloads.

I am currently working at Microsoft Research, India (M365 Research Group) with [Dr. Anjaly Parayil](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aparayil/) and [Dr. Ankur Mallick](https://ankurmallick.github.io/).
