Hi! I am currently working at Microsoft Research, India (M365 Research Group) with [Dr. Anjaly Parayil](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aparayil/) and [Dr. Ankur Mallick](https://ankurmallick.github.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems.

My work at Microsoft has focused on improving data center efficiency and serving low latency ML inference workloads. We are looking at ways to improve the serving of LLM workloads on a datacenter level, with multiple models and hardwares available and millions of requests coming in each hour.

Prior to Microsoft, I completed my Bachelors + Masters (by Research) from IIIT Hyderabad, where I was a Research Assistant at the Computer Systems Group. During my time at IIIT, I worked on building a scalable and distributed architecture for large scale camera networks, focused on a city to country wide scale. I also worked on Bayesian Optimization and how the algorithm can be adapted to various experimental settings. 

My research goal is to enable secure, private and fair use of ML capabilities for the general population. This requires algorithms which can guarantee security for the end-user data, privacy while training and efficiency and fairness during inference. Thus, the problem requires a holistic view, from machine learning algorithms to systems optimizations.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to discuss any ideas or problems!
